BASECLASS / Utilityclass / helper class / FuctionalLibrary / LibGlobal Class
============================================================================

It is a user defined class
In Baseclass we can maintain the reusable codes/methods 

==========================================================================================================

POM - Page Object Model
=======================
we have to create no f classes equal to no f pages which we r going to validate

Advantages:
we can avoid performance issue
we can remove lot of reworks
we can avoid stale element reference exception

2 types
with Pagefactory
without pagefactory

Pagefactory has below annotations
@FindBy
@FindBys
@FindAll
@CacheLookup

Pagefactory has a method initElements()
this method to used to initialize all the locators from the DOM at a single shot

How to handle StaleElementReferenceException >
By using POM FrameWork

Maintain locator separately in POJO Class (Plain Old Java Object), Declaring private variables and generate

Initializing the WebElements before usage -> Declare a constructor and Inside use PageFactory.InitElements(arg1,arg2);
PageFactory is a class and initElements is a static method in Pagefactory class , This method will initialize the WebElements (like new)
arg1 -> WebDriver reference (Driver) to perform initialization operation
arg2 -> (this) To initialize all locators present in the same class

@cachelookup
we can add this to other annotation as a add on
It is memory management
It is used to store/capture/maintain the cache of the webelement, so we can use it 
(Again script wont go to DOM to get updated webelement, It will take from here)
This may again cause stale element reference exception


Stale Element referenece exception
----------------------------------
Stale Element referenece exception occurs when we try to interact with webelement which is no longer available in the DOM

stale -> old/decayed

Eg., Amazon webpage we have search box function in all the pages we navigate

In that case if we took the locator in homepage and try to use it in any other page which it navigated

Like ., I took locator in homepage , Now I searched for some product (IPhone) and navigated to product result page , Now I want to search 
another product , I dont need to come back to homepage again , Because I have search box in all pages , so I will search there. But I wont 
take locator again I will use the same locator which I took for homepage since search box locator is same for all pages, But here I will get 
stale element reference exception because the DOM box will be refreshed while navigating to pages.
The cause is while in Homepage the the locator will have one property ID and if we navigate other page still the same locator, the property ID 
is different(changes) , here the locator is going stale , Thats why we get this exception
This is what we call Stale Element Reference Excpetion

Another best example is CricBuzz webpage which is getting refresh in samepage, so DOM will also get refresh , This will change locator Property
ID
