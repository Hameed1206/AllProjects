BASECLASS / Utilityclass / helper class / FuctionalLibrary / LibGlobal Class
============================================================================

It is a user defined class
In Baseclass we can maintain the reusable codes/methods 

==========================================================================================================

POM - Page Object Model
=======================
we have to create no f classes equal to no f pages which we r going to validate

Advantages:
we can avoid performance issue
we can remove lot of reworks
we can avoid stale element reference exception

2 types
with Pagefactory
without pagefactory

Pagefactory has below annotations
@FindBy
@FindBys
@FindAll
@CacheLookup

Pagefactory has a method initElements()
this method to used to initialize all the locators from the DOM at a single shot

How to handle StaleElementReferenceException >
By using POM Framework

Maintain locator separately in POJO Class (Plain Old Java Object), Declaring private variables and generate

Initializing the WebElements before usage -> Declare a constructor and Inside use PageFactory.InitElements(arg1,arg2);
PageFactory is a class and initElements is a static method in Pagefactory class , This method will initialize the WebElements (like new)
arg1 -> WebDriver reference (Driver) to perform initialization operation
arg2 -> (this) To initialize all locators present in the same class

@cachelookup
we can add this to other annotation as a add on
It is memory management
It is used to store/capture/maintain the cache of the webelement, so we can use it 
(Again script wont go to DOM to get updated webelement, It will take from here)
This may again cause stale element reference exception
