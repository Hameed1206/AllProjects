Stale Element referenece exception occurs when we try to interact with WebElement which is no longer available in the DOM

stale -> old/decayed

Eg., Amazon webpage we have search box function in all the pages we navigate

In that case if we took the locator in homepage and try to use it in any other page which it navigated

Like ., I took locator in homepage , Now I searched for some product (iPhone) and navigated to product result page , Now I want to search 
another product , I don't need to come back to homepage again , Because I have search box in all pages , so I will search there. But I wont 
take locator again I will use the same locator which I took for homepage since search box locator is same for all pages, But here I will get 
stale element reference exception because the DOM box will be refreshed while navigating to pages.
The cause is while in Homepage the the locator will have one property ID and if we navigate other page still the same locator, the property ID 
is different(changes) , here the locator is going stale , Thats why we get this exception
This is what we call Stale Element Reference Exception

Another best example is CricBuzz webpage which is getting refresh in same page, so DOM will also get refresh , This will change locator Property
ID
