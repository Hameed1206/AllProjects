Software Testing
================

What is testing / Why testing is mandatory ?
If software is not working fine means this will 
-Affects the confidence of user
-Loss of money
-Loss of time
-Affect the Business reputation

Software testing is a way to assess the quality of the software and to reduce the risk of software failure in operation
Risk - Something which may fail

Activities in Testing:
----------------------
Test Planning
Test Analysis
Test Design
Test Implementation
Reporting test progress and results

2 types of testing
Dynamic Testing -> Run the product and find the defect
Static Testing  -> Review the work products (Reviewing the documents RD, design, user stories, Code, Test case)

Objectives of Testing:
----------------------
-> To verify all specified requirements are fulfilled
-> To prevent defects early in lifecycle which may occur in later stages (Do static testing)
-> To build confidence in the level of quality of the product
-> To find defects to reduce the risk
-> To provide sufficient information to the stakeholders about the quality of the software
Note : Whoever interested in product are stakeholders
-> To comply with contractual, legal and regulatory requirements.

Testing and Debugging:
----------------------
Tester will find the defects and developer will debug the code to find the error and fix it
 * Debugging is a development activity -> Finding, Analyzing and fixing the defects

What is Errors, Defects, and failures

A person who develops the the software can make Error(Mistake), this will cause a failure, so a defect(fault/Bug) is opened

-----------------------------
Seven principles of testing ||
-----------------------------
1, Testing shows presence of defects, but not their absence(Testing is not a prrof of correctness)
2, Exhaustive testing is impossible
3, Early testing saves time and money
4, Defects cluster together (Identify particular module which may have more defects, so test those modules completly ASAP)
5, Beware of the pesticide paradox (Pests in a app is killed by test cases and test execution) change approach of test / change test cases so we will get error in new function because same test case wont find defects
6, Testing is context dependent
7, Absence of error is fallacy

------------------
Levels of Testing
------------------
-Unit Testing
 >Testing a particular unit of a application, Each and every unit is tested functional and Non functional.
 >White Box unit testing is done by Developers
 >Black box unit testing is done by testers

-Integration Testing
 >Units are integrated together, Here only integration is focused, whether connection done proper, how one unit affects other unit during integration, both Functional and Non funtional   wise, We will get only defects related to integration only mostly

-System Testing
 >End to End flow of application is tested here, all possible end to end flow is tested.
 >Testing done in a copy of live server

-Acceptance Testing
 >This done by customers
 >Testing will be done in their server or copy of production server
 >Checking the requirements and making sure whether appliaction is fit to go live.

-----------------
Types of Testing
-----------------

White Box Testing
-----------------
Done by developers who develop the code
He knows the internal module structure , Logic/coding behind the functions

Black Box Testing
------------------
Done by Testers , without knowing internal structure and coding

Smoke Testing
-------------
Hi level testing to ensure the build is fine, also critical functions sre working fine.

Sanity Testing
--------------
Validating the critical functionalities after new build 
Need to ensure before deploy all critical functions are working as expected


Regression Testing
------------------
Will be done in intervals
Existing functionaliities should not be affected by new development/ new updates.
All test cases will be tested / executed during regression

We check exising working functionalities is still working fine
or
Checking the consequenses in existing functions by new changes

What is Functional testing
??????????????????????????
Whether its functioning as per requirement or not

What is Non-Functional testing
??????????????????????????
Checking the behaviour of application

Performance testing ->
-------------------
check the performance of application in terms of response time
Standard response time is 3 sec

Load Testing ->
--------------
Normal load will be given to application and measure the response time

Sress Testing ->
--------------
We give stress to website in terms of user / extreme load given and measure the response time

Volume Testing ->
-----------------
Extreme data load is given to applcation and measure the response time (this is data not user)- data in type of size(mb/kb/tb/gb)

Portability Testing
Security Testing
Usability Testing
Accessability Testing
Recovery Testing
30 to 35 types of testing available in performance testing

===============================================================================================================================================
SDLC -> Software Development Life Cycle
=======================================
We have some process to develop a application

Traditional process -> Waterfall methodology (Sequential model)

Requirement gathering
Analysis of requirement
Design as per requirement and analysis
Implementation (Coding)

V-Model -> Early testing is a moto

Levels of Testing
Unit Testing
Testing a particular unit of a application
-Integration Testing
-System Testing
-Acceptance Testing
