JAVA Starts
***********

Java

JDK - Java development kit
            |
JRE - Java runtime environment 
            |
JVM - Java virtual machine

JVM runs the program it will look for main method



Concatenation operator + ( inside sysout)



Primitive and non primitive data type
--------------------------------------

Non primitive- using data type we will create object to access and we can store multiple data

Primitive- Directly assigned to variable, we can store only one value for a reference 

        Default Values

Data Type          Default Value (for fields)

short                     0

int                       0

long                      0L

float                     0.0f

Boolean                   false

String                    null


Identifiers (class, method, variable, object)

Should start in alphabet or _ or $

Cannot start with numeric or any other symbols 

Identifiers cannot take the key words which is predefined in Java 

Identifiers are case sensitive 


Operators:
=========

Arithmetic operators
--------------------

Addition + , Subtraction - , Multiplication * , Division / , modulus %

Comparison operator
-------------------
Equal to == , returns true if LHS equal to RHS
Not Equal != , returns true if LHS not equal to LHS
less than < , returns true if LHS less than RHS
greater than > , returns true if LHS Greater than RHS
less than or equal to <= , returns true if LHS less than or equal to RHS
grater than or equal to >= , returns true if LHS Greater than or equal to RHS

Logical operators
-----------------
AND &&, both condition should satisfy
OR ||, Any one condition should satisfy
NOT ! , Inverse operation, to change the result direct opposite

unary operator


how pre increment and post increment works

int a = 10;

a++ > here a is incremented to 11 (Value is changing, No addition or subtraction is performed), While coming in value is 10, While going out value is 11.
++a > Here a is incremented to 11 (Value incremented in same step itself, while inside itself its incremented and changed to 11)

(a++ + ++a + a++)
finally a = ?
in above while coming in 
value is 10 so before + value is 10 (10+
value crossing + value is incremented to 11, again there pre increment value changed to 12 (10 + 12 +
value is now 12 and crossing the +, there post increment. so value remains 12 (10+12+12)
while crossing the incremental step only its incremented to 13, so in next line a = 13.

here ++ is only changing value and performing any addition or subtraction (default value is 1)


Bitwise Operator:
-----------------
AND &, both condition should satisfy
OR |, Any one condition should satisfy
XOR ^ , Any one only should satisfy 
complement ~ , Inverse

Ternary operator perform conditional operation :
 A > B ? if true : if false
if a is greater than b, then 1st condition execute, if false means 2nd condition execute
A = 10
b = 15
A > b ? A*10 : b*10
In above a is less than b , so it will execute false condition, b*10 = 150

A < b ? A*10 : b*10
In above a is less than b , so condition true,  it will execute True condition, A*10 = 100
