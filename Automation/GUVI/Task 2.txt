Test Case Design Techniques

Question : 1 ->

Test Scenario 1
===============
Test Case 1 : Validating without appointment data
Enter Valid data in Firstname field
Enter Valid data in Lastname field
Enter Valid data in Email field
Enter Valid data in Phone Number field
In appointment Field Don't choose any, just leave empty and try to book

Expected Result : It should display error "All fields are required"

Test Case 2 : Validating without Phone number
Enter Valid data in Firstname field
Enter Valid data in Lastname field
Enter Valid data in Email field
Leave the Phone Number field Empty/Blank
In appointment Field choose a available slot

Expected Result : It should display error "All fields are required"

Test Case 3 : Validating without Email data
Enter Valid data in Firstname field
Enter Valid data in Lastname field
Leave the Email field Empty/Blank
Enter Valid data in Phone Number field
In appointment Field choose a available slot

Expected Result : It should display error "All fields are required"

Test Case 4 : Validating without Last name data
Enter Valid data in Firstname field
Leave the Lastname field Empty/Blank
Enter Valid data in Email field
Enter Valid data in Phone Number field
In appointment Field choose a available slot

Expected Result : It should display error "All fields are required"

Test Case 5 : Validating without First name data
Leave the Firstname field Empty/Blank
Enter Valid data in Lastname field
Enter Valid data in Email field
Enter Valid data in Phone Number field
In appointment Field choose a available slot

Expected Result : It should display error "All fields are required"

With the above approach we can ensure the if any field is left blank then we should not book appointment.

Test Scenario 2
===============
Test Case 1 : Validating with Invalid email (eg., Without @ symbol)
Enter Valid data in Firstname field
Enter Valid data in Lastname field
Enter InValid Email in email field (eg., Enter without @ symbol)
Enter Valid data in Phone Number field
In appointment Field choose a available slot

Expected Result : It should display error "Please enter a valid email"

Test Case 2 : Validating with Invalid email (eg., Without .
Enter Valid data in Firstname field
Enter Valid data in Lastname field
Enter InValid Email in email field (eg., Enter without . symbol)
Enter Valid data in Phone Number field
In appointment Field choose a available slot

Expected Result : It should display error "Please enter a valid email"

Test Case 3 : Validating with more than one @ symbol.
Enter Valid data in Firstname field
Enter Valid data in Lastname field
Enter InValid Email in email field (eg., Enter @ symbol twice)
Enter Valid data in Phone Number field
In appointment Field choose a available slot

Expected Result : It should display error "Please enter a valid email"

Test Case 4 : Validating with more than one . symbol
Enter Valid data in Firstname field
Enter Valid data in Lastname field
Enter InValid Email in email field (eg., Enter . symbol twice)
Enter Valid data in Phone Number field
In appointment Field choose a available slot

Expected Result : It should display error "Please enter a valid email"

Test Case 5 : Validating with continous special characters
Enter Valid data in Firstname field
Enter Valid data in Lastname field
Enter InValid Email in email field (eg., Enter @ and . symbols together like @.)
Enter Valid data in Phone Number field
In appointment Field choose a available slot

Expected Result : It should display error "Please enter a valid email"

In the above approches we are trying to enter invalid email like without @ or . symbols.
Any email ID will have @ and . symbols. So If the data entered in field dont have these symbols means it should throw error
Also we are testing by giving each symbols twice and also together, which are also not valid email , So the page should throw error as "Please enter a valid email".

---------------------------------------

Test Scenario 3
===============

Test Case 1 :
Enter Valid data in Firstname field
Enter Valid data in Lastname field
Enter Valid data in Email field
Enter InValid Phone Number in Phone number field (eg., Enter 9 digit no)
In appointment Field choose a available slot

Expected Result : It should display error "Please enter a valid Phone Number"

Test Case 2 :
Enter Valid data in Firstname field
Enter Valid data in Lastname field
Enter Valid data in Email field
Enter InValid Phone Number in Phone number field (eg., Enter 11 digit no)
In appointment Field choose a available slot

Expected Result : It should display error "Please enter a valid Phone Number"


Test Case 3 :
Enter Valid data in Firstname field
Enter Valid data in Lastname field
Enter Valid data in Email field
Enter InValid Phone Number in Phone number field (eg., Enter 9 digit no and 1 alphabet)
In appointment Field choose a available slot

Expected Result : It should display error "Please enter a valid Phone Number"

Test Case 4 :
Enter Valid data in Firstname field
Enter Valid data in Lastname field
Enter Valid data in Email field
Enter InValid Phone Number in Phone number field (eg., Enter 10 digit no and 1 alphabet)
In appointment Field choose a available slot

Expected Result : It should display error "Please enter a valid Phone Number"

In above case we are trying to validated the phone number field with invalid data
So we are using boundary value analysis technique
In case 1 and 2 we are giving phone number with 9 and 11 digits, Any phone number will ahve 10 digits, so the field should not accept the data other than 10 digits.
In case 3 and 4 I am trying to give 9/10 numbers and 1 alphabet to ensure it accepts only numerical value.

-------------------------------------

Test Scenario 4
===============

Test Case 1 :
Enter Valid data in Firstname field
Enter Valid data in Lastname field
Enter Valid data in Email field
Enter Valid data in Phone Number field
In appointment Field choose a slot which is already booked

Expected Result : Form should not be submitted and display error as "Please choose another date/time"

Test Case 2 :
Enter Valid data in Firstname field
Enter Valid data in Lastname field
Enter Valid data in Email field
Enter Valid data in Phone Number field
In appointment Field choose a slot which is not available (Like outside range)

Expected Result : Form should not be submitted and display error as "Please choose another date/time"

Test Case 3 :
Enter Valid data in Firstname field
Enter Valid data in Lastname field
Enter Valid data in Email field
Enter Valid data in Phone Number field
In appointment Field choose a slot from past date/Time

Expected Result : Form should not be submitted and display error as "Please choose another date/time"

-----------------------------------------------

Test Scenario 5
===============

Test Case 1 :
Enter Valid data in Firstname field
Enter Valid data in Lastname field
Enter Valid data in Email field
Enter Valid data in Phone Number field
In appointment Field choose a available slot

Expected Result : Appointment should be succuessfully scheduled.
