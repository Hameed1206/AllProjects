Objects

ClassName c = new ClassName();

Classname c = d;
Here we copied all contents from c to d. But we didn't created new instance, we are just sharing the instance
Both c and d will point to same memory location
any changes we made either c or d , both objects will have the change
finally both will reflect the same output

Public class Student{

Student a = new Student();
Student b = new Student();
Student c = new Student();
Student d = new Student();

public Student(Student object){
int a = object;

}
Student e = new Student(object ref = d);
In above we are creating new object and passing all the data's from reference d
now e will have all data's from d and if we want we can add data's to e, but the changes made in e won't affect d.
Since we created new object for e, but changes in d will be reflected in e.

In above we have created the parameteized constructor and and added arguments to use object reference this is called
Copy Construtor, here we are maintaining objects with similar contents and little changes
