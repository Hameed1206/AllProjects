Pop up in selenium
==================

3 Types of pop up

-> Alerts - JavaScript popup
-> File Upload pop up 
-> New Browser window pop up

Alerts - JavaScript popup
=========================
Normal alert messsage we get in browser , we can use alert concept from selenium
Alert a = driver.switchTo().alert();
a.accept();
a.dismiss();
a.getText();
a.sendKeys();
we can use all above option to handle alerts

File Upload pop up 
==================
To upload a file , locate the browse/file upload button and with sendKeys method pass the file location and name
But make sure in dom html tag we have type = "File" then only we can use above option

New Browser window pop up
=========================

Its a new window, so we can use windows handling concept

Set<String> windows = driver.getWindowHandles();
Here we use iterator concept to switch between windows , since we cannot use for loop and index concept
Iterator<String> it = windows.iterator();
This iterator will stand at the top outside , if we give next() once it will move to 1st parent window and again give next() for following child window
String id1 = it.next();   -> Parent window

String id2 = it.next();   -> child window

Now driver.switchTo().window(id1/id2);
