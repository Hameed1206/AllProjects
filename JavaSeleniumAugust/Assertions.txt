Assertions
Assertions helps us to verify the condition of the test and decide whether test is passed or failed. 

Two types 
Hard Assertion 
Soft Assertion 

Hard Assertion, 
if there is any failure, it will not proceed further and stops the execution. 
Assert.assertTrue(true) = If the boolean value is true, assert will be true and test will pass. 
Assert.assertFalse(false) = If the boolean value is false, assert will be true and test will pass. 
Assert.assertEquals(Expectal, Actual) =  If the expected and actual value matches, assert will be true and test will pass. 

Soft Assert, 
if there is any failure, it will inform the failure and proceed further with the execution. 

Soft Assert obj = new SoftAssert(); 

obj.assertTrue(true) = If the boolean value is true, assert will be true and test will pass. 
obj.assertFalse(false) = If the boolean value is false, assert will be true and test will pass. 
obj.assertEquals(Expectal, Actual) =  If the expected and actual value matches, assert will be true and test will pass. 
obj.assertAll() = Cause and exception when assert fails should be mentioned in the end of the assert.
