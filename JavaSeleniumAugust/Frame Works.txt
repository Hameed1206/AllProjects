Frame Works:
============

Why do we need framework ?

-> Framework is a code structure that helps to make the code maintenance easy
-> To reduce the work compared to selenium
-> Without frameworks, we will place code and data in same class, which cannot be reused
-> Using framework we can maintain the code structure with increased code reusability and reduce cost of maintaining code
