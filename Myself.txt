Myself J. Hameed Hussain. 
I have completed my schooling in 2013. During my school days, I was very good in Maths. I like Maths. I will easily understand Maths. So Maths is my very comfort zone during my school days. I was also doing a part time of working in a small retail shop. So the shop sales will be 50,000 to 1 lakh. It's a retail shop, electrical and hardware items in Chennai. So I know how to calculate, when a customer purchases lot of goods, so I will write it down in a paper, a quotation paper, and we will manually calculate it. So we always won't depend on a calculator. So I have, I was comfort in this manual calculation. So we will do, you know, like some 30 to 50 goods, so different price. So we will able to, I was able to do a manual calculation for it. So that's also my nature and I would say it's my skill. This is what I was doing in my school days. 
Then I took Mechanical Engineering and I completed in 2017. So I haven't learned Mechanical, I was just enjoying my college. Yet, if any problematic paper comes, I am little comfort. So I will know, I will learn how much I want to learn if I need to clear the subject. So I will learn and I will clear the subject. Other than I am not studied any Mechanical Engineering concepts, just I am comfort in this mathematical type of, problems kind of papers. 
So in between college also, I will always work in some retail shops, different shops. There I will do manual calculations on my own. So yes, this is what up to me till 2017, Up to I complete my college.

Important point : How I am good in maths, Actually my father is good in maths, My mom also some what better, so may be its from gene.

So after college, I was searching jobs that suited to my mechanical engineering. I worked in some 2-3 small companies just as a machine operator. 
Then I wanted to switch to HVAC profile. I joined in a small company. I worked there for 3 and a half months as a helper or a support. Just I wanted to learn HVAC. So I worked in HVAC, the AC service side. And I was trying to understand the field. 
Then I studied HVAC course, 2 months course. So how to calculate heat load calculations. How to design a duct and specifications.
Then I joined in a HVAC company. There I worked for 3 years from 2018 May to 2021 May. So during this time, I was working in different type of sites. So I will be in the role of executing the plan. So whatever the HVAC plan for the buildings, small commercial buildings. So with the design and the cost, I will be arranging the manpower and material. And I will complete the work. Then after I joined another company in 2021 June. Then I worked for 3 months. The same work. 
So in the meantime, I will always focus on quality. So I won't satisfy the quality until it was great. So I just wanted to make the thing right at the first time. I don't want the rework. This is what I was doing until 2021 September. So after college till 2021 September, my profile was HVAC engineer.

so during 2021 september i wanted to switch to a different profile because my earning is less, then i choose automation testing,
Then i joined a automation testing course, java selenium. I learned java selenium frameworks like testing, cucumber from october 2021 to december 2021 i was learning these things.
So in Jan 2022 starting i got a job as a automation test engineer i worked there for almost two years in the same role 
I was just working on somewhat java selenium then little much sql and little much unix this is what i was working during these two years 
Also in these two years one year i lead a team, not in the same profile, but different one, it's a kind of a regression jobs we have in run in UI tool, just to run it and monitor the flow in the unix environmrnt.
So to this particular job i was a team lead. I will take care of these jobs running and its failure noting down and reporting the developer and noting down the downtime and preparing the documents this is what I do for this particular role and also i was a team lead for this small team 
Other than this i am doing some automation stuff using java selenium 
I am not aware of sql just learned in unix how to use this described command with database name (desc database_name) which means you will get all the column name so using that i know how to customize a small query, just a query with some limited conditions, not advanced level, Very basic level.
Also Unix basic commands, this is what i wanted to do for my role. So I learned this small basics of SQL and Unix. This is what i was doing for two years from jan 22 to december 2023

So, in December 2023, I lost job due to this market was down, so it was a layoff season. So, I was laid off. Then after that, I was preparing for interview. I was attending some interviews for this automation testing, Java, Selenium. So, I am not able to place any job since the salary range was very less. So, due to this, I didn't get job. So, 
I decided to take a course again, Java, Selenium in some other professional institute. And I expected a placement from them. Then, I planned on 2024 January. Then, in March starting, the course got started. Again, I studied Java, Selenium, manual testing, Cucumber testNG. I was doing all the task in the course. I did a project too. 
So, in June, I completed the course. And in July starting, I got the certification with high mark. 
In the meanwhile also, I was continuing to attend the interviews. But, I was not able to crack the offer because my previous package was higher. So, I was not able to make a offers since the budget was not there. Even, I accepted to come for less salary. They are not ready to take. Since they are afraid, I will be moving on if I get a better opportunity. 
So, this kept on going. Then, the institute also gave me some openings I am attending those interviews too. 
Then, in August end, I cracked one interview. They accepted me to take. Then, in September, I joined. 
So, in December 2023, I left my job. Again, in September 2024 only, I got into another job. So, this is what I was doing from December 2023 mid to 2024 August end.

So in September 2024, I joined as an automation tester in a company. So initially, my package was an entry-level package. 
Initially, they asked me to learn JavaScript. Since they are using JavaScript, they are not using the usual style like other companies. They have developed a separate tool called Terra.  what is the tool is about? It's actually based on a Node-RED. So it has a lot of nodes, and in nodes, the scripts were already written. There is a base script, and there are multiple keywords. For example, in Selenium, for URL, we have one keyword. For send keys, we have one keyword. For every action, there is a separate keyword. 
So a user can drag and drop the keyword where he wants to perform the action. So then if we just run the UI, then all this performance will happen. 
So the architecture is like the XPath will be stored in one location. Script will be there. If you drag and drop, then the operation will be performed. 
So there is no need of again writing a script in local Eclipse or VS Code. So we just need to maintain that script and keyword which we have in our application called Terra. 
So for that, I have learned the basics of JavaScript. Just if need, we need to do some small modifications in script and keyword. So for this purpose, I started to understand the basics of JavaScript. Then after that one month, they teached me how the tool behaves, what is architecture, what are the features that's available in the tool. One month I learned, then one month I practiced. Then after that, they have reviewed me. They have given me a small task using their tool. I want to automate a mobile application to read a OTP. So I tried and I did it. 
Then they asked me to take the base script. So base script is developed by some senior most people. So they asked me to understand the base script and if need, need to do some changes. So I took some time and I completely understand what's happening in the base script. Then I was able to make some small, small changes in the base script. So till December, I was doing all these things. 
Also, parallelly I was attending the interview in some other product based company. Also, I got offered for a very good package. Then I decided to move on from here. 
I informed here, my manager, I want to leave the group. Then they asked me the reason. I told salary is not enough, then they told that as my performance was better, they don't want to leave me and they ready to offer the same package which the other company was willing to provide. So they asked me to continue here. I accepted and continued. 
Initially I joined in a contract role. It's six months contract. During contract they told will make permanent if performance was better. 
So within four months, so I was planned for leave, but they told your performance was better. We want to retain you and we are ready to provide you a better offer. 
So initially I joined for a entry level package 3.5 LPA. So after that, I got converted to  full time employee with 200% hike. Now my package was 10.5 LPA. 
Then from February, I was started my new role as a permanent employee. 
Then as a new role, they wanted me to develop and create framework 
Since there tool itself application. It also need to be tested. It also has automation side.
So, since 2.5 years, using their tool, they have automated the tool. So, they have a lot of test cases automated. So, all automation was done using a Selenium, JavaScript . 
Now, they wanted me to convert everything to JavaScript playwright. We had one playwright base script. So, they have given me, with that, I need to create playwright keywords 
Since it's a keyword structure, I already have a Selenium script in my keyword. So, what I will do simply, I will put that keyword in ChatGPT and I will ask for a playwright version and I will get that version. I will put that version in the keyword and I will run it. If any small, small error comes, I will understand since I have some coding knowledge and fix it. If I was not able then I will ask ChatGPT and it will give me a solution. 
In this way I was preparing a new playwright set of framework. So, this was the task assigned to me. So, I was started in the mid of Jan for a playwright version. Then I have tested all the conditions in end of March. So, in the mid period, they asked to take some of the regression cases. I took it, the responsibility of it. Then April, I was ready with playwright framework. 
Then we want to replace the logics in our existing running cases. So, we decided, so this will break the regression. So, we will go for a test run. 
So, we created a separate instance and we replaced the keyword logics from selenium to playwright. 
So, May end, we started these activities. And as you know, it's going on. I was replacing all the Selenium logics with playwright and testing how our application behaves and what are the changes that need to be done. So, I mostly face issues like when it won't accept this multiple xpath occurrence. So, I'm just noting down everything just to change, just to make change in the original flow. So, as of now, for testing purpose, we have separate instance where I am testing all the playwright version, how it behaves with our script. So, this is what I am doing from January to till now. It's almost July.
I was doing these migration and script update activities individually , not associated with any one

********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************


Also, I have not learned playwright, just referring in google and chatGPT I did above tasks, If asked I dont even know the first step to write a playwright coding for automation and Javascript too, But with Java selenium I will develop a framework itself by my own.


********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

That is an *excellent and honest insight*, Hameed — and this clarity actually makes your next steps even clearer.

Let me summarize what this means and what you can do:

---

# 🎯 Where you *actually* stand now

✅ **Strong in Java + Selenium + TestNG + Cucumber** — you can design, develop, and maintain a framework entirely on your own here.
✅ **Framework & XPath/CSS knowledge** — very solid.
✅ **Web architecture understanding** — good.
✅ **Leadership & ownership** — demonstrated.

🚧 **Weak in JavaScript & Playwright** —
➝ You’ve managed to deliver Playwright-related tasks by referring to Google & ChatGPT, but you don’t really understand the concepts deeply.
➝ You don’t know how to start a Playwright automation project from scratch yourself.
➝ You’re not confident in JavaScript either.

---

# 🔷 Why this is OK (for now)?

What you’ve done so far (delivering the migration with resourcefulness) is still valuable — because the ability to figure things out, even without mastery, is a skill employers respect.
BUT — if you want to move up and *own* these technologies confidently (and avoid getting exposed in interviews or higher roles), you do need to actually learn Playwright & JavaScript properly.

---

# 📚 What you should do now

Here’s a **practical plan** to close this gap while still building on your strengths:

---

## 1️⃣ Keep using your **Java + Selenium** as your strong foundation

* Highlight in your resume & LinkedIn that you’re a **framework developer in Java + Selenium**.
* If asked about Playwright: you can honestly say
  *“I have delivered Playwright automation by referring to documentation & tools, and I’m currently investing time to deepen my knowledge and write Playwright scripts & frameworks from scratch.”*

---

## 2️⃣ Learn **Playwright properly**

Here’s how to learn Playwright in 2–3 weeks:
🔷 Spend the first few days learning **JavaScript fundamentals** (variables, loops, arrays, functions, promises, async/await). FreeCodeCamp & MDN are good resources.
🔷 Install Node.js & Playwright locally → Learn to write simple scripts:

* open browser
* navigate to a page
* click buttons & enter text
* assert conditions
  🔷 Gradually move to advanced topics:
* running tests in parallel
* working with locators
* writing reusable functions
* integrating with CI/CD
  🔷 Do a small sample project & push it to GitHub.

If you’d like, I can also:
✅ Create a **step-by-step learning roadmap for Playwright + JavaScript**.
✅ Write you a **beginner Playwright project template** you can start practicing with.

---

## 3️⃣ Manage expectations at work

Since you already got a promotion & they value your performance:

* Be proactive and let your manager know you’re continuing to strengthen your Playwright & JS knowledge.
* Volunteer for more Playwright-related tasks so you practice under guidance.

---

# 🔷 Final advice

You are not “faking” anything — you delivered value already.
But if you want to grow confidently, especially if you want to move toward **SDET / Architect / Lead**, you can’t depend on Google/ChatGPT forever — you need to actually learn & practice Playwright + JavaScript.

---

### 📌 Suggested wording for interviews:

> *“I delivered Playwright migration tasks by leveraging documentation & tools, and I’m now working on deepening my knowledge to develop Playwright frameworks from scratch, just as I already can with Java + Selenium.”*

---

### Next Steps I recommend:

✅ Build a **Playwright + JS learning plan**
✅ Do a small GitHub project for Playwright automation
✅ Update LinkedIn with honest strengths & in-progress skills
✅ Stay focused on growing into a **QA Lead or Automation Architect** role

---

If you want, I can prepare for you:
📋 A **step-by-step Playwright + JS roadmap**
📝 A **sample beginner-to-advanced Playwright project**
🎯 A **6–12 month career development roadmap**

Would you like me to start with any of these? Let me know!

My team mates is doing 5 years Datasciene, AI course in IIT madras, since its future and high paying profile, till now I dont idea for it, Will that will suitable for me, depending on my skills. can you advice


********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************


That’s a very thoughtful question — and I’m really glad you asked it instead of just jumping in because others are doing it.

Let me help you assess this properly, step by step:

---

# 🚩 1. Why people are moving into Data Science / AI?

✅ It’s a growing field: AI, ML, and Data Science are indeed in demand and pay well.
✅ There are many interesting problems to solve — predicting patterns, training models, NLP, computer vision, etc.
✅ Some of the highest-paying roles today are in these areas.

BUT:
It’s also a field that is…
📈 Highly competitive.
📚 Requires a **solid foundation in math & statistics, programming, and data analysis**.
⏳ Requires patience — it can take 1–3+ years to really become competent enough to earn at a high level.

---

# 🚩 2. Are your current skills aligned?

Here’s what you already have that is relevant:
✅ Strong at math & logic (you’ve liked math since childhood).
✅ Strong problem-solving skills.
✅ You’re disciplined and persistent — you managed to switch from HVAC to automation, which shows you can learn and adapt.
✅ Comfortable with programming (in Java at least).

But here’s what you currently lack (and would need to build):
🔷 Deep knowledge of **statistics & probability**.
🔷 Comfort with **Python & libraries like pandas, numpy, sklearn, tensorflow, pytorch**.
🔷 Understanding of **data wrangling, modeling, machine learning algorithms, neural networks**.

---

# 🚩 3. Will Data Science / AI suit you?

✨ If you truly enjoy analyzing numbers, spotting patterns, solving puzzles, and don’t mind spending time learning math & algorithms → then yes, you can absolutely succeed.
✨ If you enjoy coding & experimenting with models → then yes.
🚧 But if you find math beyond basic algebra/probability boring or if you don’t enjoy working with datasets for hours — then it may feel frustrating.

---

# 🚩 4. Is it better than Automation Testing for you?

Not necessarily “better” — it depends on:

* Your **interest**
* Your willingness to learn and invest time
* The kind of problems you enjoy solving

You are already **well-positioned in QA/automation**, which also pays very well at senior levels and has growing opportunities — e.g., Test Architect, SDET, DevOps-integrated testing roles, Performance & Security Testing — some roles here pay ₹20–30+ LPA in India.

---

# 📋 My Honest Advice:

✅ Data Science / AI *is an option* for you — because of your math & logical mindset.
✅ But you don’t *have to* switch just because your teammate is doing it — your current path can also take you to a high-paying & respected role.
✅ If you’re genuinely curious about Data Science / AI:
— Start small: take a free course (Coursera/EdX) or a small project.
— See if you enjoy it.
— If yes, consider investing in the 5-year program.
— If no, focus on mastering QA/Automation and growing there — which already suits you well.

---

# 🎯 Next step:

If you want, I can:
✨ Help you compare **career paths: QA Lead/Test Architect vs Data Scientist** in detail.
✨ Suggest some **free beginner resources for Data Science**, so you can test your interest before committing.
✨ Create a **plan to grow in your current field + optionally learn Data Science on the side.**

********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Give me a clarity on below, I started studying Automation testing(Java selenium) in Oct 2021 and completed in Dec 2021, Then joined 1st job in Jan 2022 and left in Dec 2023, from Jan 2024 to Aug 2024 I am unemployed, just doing couse and learning, then Sep 2024 I joined 2nd job and still working there,, Now whats my overall experiance as automation tester I should mention resume, what I should do for my career gap, Jan 2024 to Aug 2024

********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

This is an *excellent question* — and you’re absolutely right to get clarity on how to present your experience and career gap honestly and strategically.

Let’s address it clearly and practically 👇

---

# 📌 1. What is your **overall experience as an Automation Tester**?

✅ You started learning automation in **Oct 2021 – Dec 2021**.
✅ Joined your **1st job** as Automation Tester:
**Jan 2022 – Dec 2023** → \~ **2 years**
✅ Career gap:
**Jan 2024 – Aug 2024** → \~ **8 months**
✅ Joined your **2nd job**:
**Sep 2024 – Present** → as of now \~ **10 months** (since it’s July 2025 now)

So your **total industry experience as Automation Tester** is:
🎯 Jan 2022 → July 2025 = \~ **3 years and 6 months**
You can confidently mention **\~3.5 years of Automation Testing experience** on your resume & LinkedIn.
(Companies count your working experience, not the time you spent learning before your first job.)

---

# 📌 2. How to handle the career gap (Jan–Aug 2024)?

First — it’s **normal** to have a gap, especially during layoffs & tough job markets.
You don’t need to feel nervous about it.
Since during this period you:

* Took a **formal course in automation (again)**
* Practiced Java, Selenium, frameworks, manual testing
* Completed a **project & certification**
* Actively attended interviews

You can position this period as **Professional Development / Upskilling & Job Search**, not as “idle.”

For example, on your resume or if asked in an interview, you can say:

> *Jan 2024 – Aug 2024: Focused on enhancing my skills in automation testing by completing an advanced Selenium + Java course, working on a project, and earning a certification while actively pursuing new opportunities.*

On the resume, you don’t even have to explicitly write it as a job — but you can mention it under *Certifications & Trainings*, and if they ask about the gap you can explain exactly like above.

---

# 📌 3. Should you show the gap at all?

Yes — you should never try to “hide” it (like changing dates to fill the gap), but you also don’t have to make it bigger than it is.
Focus on what you **did** in that time: learning, improving, preparing.
You can optionally include a line in your resume under Certifications like:

> *Jan–Aug 2024: Full-time upskilling & certification in Automation Testing, while exploring new opportunities.*

That way it’s clear that you invested your time productively.

---

# 📌 4. For interviews: What to say if they ask about the gap?

Prepare an honest & confident answer:

> *After my previous role ended in Dec 2023 due to layoffs, I decided to invest time in upgrading my skills. I enrolled in an advanced automation testing program, completed a project, and earned a certification. Alongside, I actively attended interviews to find a role aligned with my skills and expectations, which I did in Sep 2024.*

That’s professional, honest, and shows initiative.
No one will hold a gap like this against you — especially since you now have a stable job & stronger skills.

Ok, But I have learned manual testing and concepts, But I have not worked in it, I dont like writing test cases and doing manual testing, I am afraid of it too

********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

✅ Excellent point — and very insightful of you to reflect on this *before* misrepresenting yourself or falling into a role you don’t enjoy.

Let me explain and guide you clearly:

---

# 🚩 1. Is it okay that you learned manual testing but never worked in it?

Yes, absolutely okay.

In fact, most automation testers learn the basics of **manual testing concepts** (like SDLC, STLC, defect lifecycle, writing test cases, functional testing, etc.) because they are *fundamental to understanding what to automate*.

BUT —
You don’t have to *work as a manual tester*, and you don’t have to claim that you’re good at it if you’re not interested.

You’ve already chosen the path of **automation & frameworks**, and that’s perfectly valid — there are plenty of people who specialize only in automation.

---

# 🚩 2. Should you write “Manual Testing” in your resume?

You can honestly mention:

* *“Good understanding of manual testing concepts and processes.”*

But avoid putting “Experienced in writing test cases” or “Manual Tester” if you haven’t done it and don’t want to do it.
You can frame it as:

> *Familiar with SDLC, STLC, defect lifecycle, and test planning concepts. Strong focus on automation testing & frameworks.*

That way, it’s clear you understand the fundamentals, but your **specialty is automation**.

---

# 🚩 3. Is it wrong to dislike writing test cases & manual work?

Not at all.
Many automation engineers feel the same — because their mindset is about optimizing, coding, automating repetitive tasks — not manually clicking through scenarios or writing step-by-step cases.

That’s also why **automation testing exists** — to avoid unnecessary manual work.
So your dislike of manual work is actually aligned with your role — just be careful to still understand *what needs to be tested and why*, so you can automate it effectively.

---

# 🚩 4. What to say in interviews if they ask:

> *Have you done manual testing?*
> You can answer honestly:
> *I have a good understanding of manual testing concepts — SDLC, STLC, writing test scenarios — which helps me decide what and how to automate. However, my focus and expertise have been in developing and maintaining automation frameworks and automating test scenarios.*

---

# 📋 Final Advice:

✅ Keep learning the concepts of manual testing — because they help you write *better automation*.
✅ Don’t claim hands-on experience in manual testing if you haven’t done it.
✅ Don’t feel afraid of it — no one expects an automation engineer to be a full-time manual tester.

---

If you want, I can help you phrase this properly in your:
✨ Resume — a clear section about manual testing knowledge without overpromising
✨ Interview — a short, confident answer
✨ LinkedIn — balanced to show your strengths in automation but familiarity with manual concepts
