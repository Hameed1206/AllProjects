1. npm install:
Purpose:

npm install is used to install all the dependencies listed in a project's package.json file. These dependencies are typically necessary for running, developing, or building the project.
What It Does:

When you run npm install, npm (Node Package Manager) reads the package.json file in the current directory and installs all the packages listed under the dependencies and devDependencies sections.
The installed packages are placed in a node_modules directory inside your project.
If there is a package-lock.json file, npm uses it to install the exact versions of dependencies specified in it, ensuring consistency across different environments.
Typical Use Case:

You run npm install after cloning a repository or when a projectâ€™s dependencies need to be installed for the first time.
It can also be used to install a new package and add it to the package.json file by running npm install <package-name>.


2. npm start:
Purpose:

npm start is used to run a script defined in the package.json file under the scripts section, typically to start a Node.js application.
What It Does:

When you run npm start, npm looks for a start script in the scripts section of the package.json file and executes it.
The start script can be anything, but it is commonly used to start a web server, a development environment, or an application.
If no start script is defined, npm will try to run node server.js by default.
Typical Use Case:

You use npm start to launch your application after setting up the environment and dependencies.
It's often used in combination with npm install, where you install the dependencies first and then start the application.
