**Top 10 Rest Assured Functions that every SDET should know!**



1\. given(): The given() method is used to set up the request specification. You can add headers, parameters etc.



Ex: given()

.header("Content-Type", "application/json")

.param("key", "value")



2\. when(): The when() method is used to define the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) \& the endpoint for the request



Ex: when()

.get("/api/users/2")



3\. then(): method is used to define the response validations \& assertions



Ex: then()

.statusCode(200)

.body("data.id", equalTo(2))



Use Case: Validating the status code \& response body after making a request



4\. statusCode(): The statusCode() method is used to assert the expected HTTP status code of the response



Ex:

then() .statusCode(200) (as can be seen above)



5\. body(): The body() method is used to assert specific parts of the response body



Ex:

then() .body("data.email", equalTo("janet.weaver@reqres.in"))



Use Case:

Validating that the response body if it contains the expected data



6\. log().all(): The log().all() method is used to log the details of the request and response for debugging purposes



Ex:

given() .log().all() when() .get("/api/users/2") .then() .log().all()



7\. header(): The header() method is used to add a single header to the request



Ex:

given() .header("Authorization", "Bearer token")



Use Case:

Including an authorization token in the request header



8\. param(): The param(), or queryParam(), method is used to add query parameters to the request



Example:

given() .param("page", 2)



Use Case:

Sending a query parameter to paginate the results of a GET request



9\. contentType(): The contentType() method is used to set the content type of the request.

Example:

given() .contentType(ContentType.JSON)



Use Case:

Specifying that the request payload is in JSON format



10\. extract():

The extract() method is used to extract parts of the response for further validation or use



Example:

Response response = given() .when() .get("/api/users/2") .then() .extract() .response(); String email = response.path("data.email");



Use Case:

Extracting the response data to perform additional assertions or operations





Rest Assured- Interview Questions

1) Difference between Path and Query Parameters with an example

2)How to send a GET request using Rest Assured?

3)How to log a response in Rest Assured only in the case of an error.

4) Explain different ways of extracting a single field from a response body. [like using response, JSONPath, XMLPath) and also they will give you the response of a request and ask you to extract the response of a particular field.

5) How to mask header information in API testing using Rest Assured?

6)How to download a file using rest assured?

7)How do you handle form parameters and multipart parameters [uploading media files]?

8) They will give you an end to end scenario and ask how you will write the rest assured code for that they are trying to understand how well you can do the API chaining here, you can just explain also]

9) What import statement will you use for Rest Assured to work?
