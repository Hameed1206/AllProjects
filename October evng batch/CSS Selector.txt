CSS Selector
============

Css is faster than xpath
It can travel only in forward direction
we can't use text to find css selector

To access ID , we can use # with id value like #value

To access class, we can use . with value  like .value

also 
we can use tagname#value for id
           tagname.value for class

input[id='password']


div.value > div   -> immediate child
div.value div  -> all descantants


to point only childs--
form[id='nav-search-bar-form'] > div:nth-of-type(3)

to point all descantants
form[id='nav-search-bar-form'] div:nth-of-type(3)
