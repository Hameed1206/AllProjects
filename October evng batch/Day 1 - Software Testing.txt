SDLC
====
Software Development lifecycle (SDLC)

Client/Customer will provided the requirement to BA.
Business Analyst (BA)
BA will prepare the Business Requirement document(BRD)/ Business Requirement specification(BRS)
BA will conduct meeting with Team Leads and discuss about the Requirement.

SDLC Phases, , ,
1, Requirement Analysis
2, Design 
3, Development
4, Testing & Error addressing (Defect) and Fixing  -> Retest  
5, Deployment    -> Real world
6, Maintenance


Requirement Analysis
====================
Requirement gathering / Analysis of requirement
Designer, Developer and Tester all should analyse what is the requirement and deliverable.
Based on requirement only designer will design the webpage,
Developer will develop the website and its functions,
Tester will do testing based on requirement

BA will explain the requirement to everyone, if any doubts we have means we can clarify there itself.

Two major approach for Testing:
-------------------------------
1, Manual Testing
Write and execute the test cases without any help of tool support.

2, Automation Testing
Write and execute the test Scripts with the help of tool support.

Two major types of testing:
---------------------------
1, Functional Testing
2, Non Functional Testing

Functional -> Validating fields
Non Functional -> Validating time of response
