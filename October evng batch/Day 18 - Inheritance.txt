Inheritance
===========
Accessing methods from different classes / Inherit methods from different classes
We can access one class methods from another class using extends keyword

Advantages:
-----------
Code reusable purpose
avoid memory wastage
Hierarchy between classes
Uses Extends Keyword

Types of Inheritance
--------------------
1, Single inheritance
2, Multilevel inheritance
3, Hierarchical inheritance
4, Multiple inheritance         ->  
5, hybrid inheritance


1, Single inheritance :
-----------------------
Combination of One parent class  and One child class 

      class A  (parent)
          | extends
      class B  (child)


2, Multilevel inheritance
--------------------------
More than one parent class accessing the child class in tree level structure

ClassA    ->    ClassB    ->    ClassC
Grand Parent     Parent          Child

A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> G -> H

Example ::
----------
Class A has 2 methods
class b has 2 methods

B extends A
class B has both methods from A and B -> 4 methods

Class C has 2 methods
C extends B
Now C has 6 methods from all A, B and C

       class A    great grand parent
          |
       class B    grand parent
          |
       class C    parent
          |
       class D    Child

In class D we can access for all above 3 class methods

3, Hierarchical inheritance
----------------------------
one parent class is accessed by more than one child class / Multiple child class

                            class A (Parent)
          -------------------------|------------------------
         |                |                |                |
         |extends A       |extends A       |extends A       |extends A 
      class B           class C          class D          class E
