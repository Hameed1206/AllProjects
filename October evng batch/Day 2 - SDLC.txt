SDLC
====
Software Development life cycle

Requirement Analysis
====================
Client -> Requires application and approaching -> organization > I need a ticket booking application
Client -> Giving requirement as location - India -> Transport mode - Bus, Train, Flight  -> Include All major cities -> In Homepage need Login & Registration option -> Based on requirement Organization will prepare Quotation-> Quotation and budget will be given to client

Communication
Client -> Organization(BA)
BA ->  Business Analyst -> Design, Developer, Tester
BA will explains the requirement to all the tech peoples, If they have doubt means they can ask and get it cleared


Design 
======
Design the template of the application
design is approved by client through mail or by any other means of communication they adopted


Development
============
Will develop the application using,
Coding -> Java, Python, JavaScript
Lot of technologies

In a team we will have More than one developers

Assume we have 3 developers

Each developer will develop a unit of functions and he will validate each unit after development (Unit Testing)

All the 3 developed Modules will be combined and given to testers for further testing
For Eg.,
Developer 1 develops 3 functions(Login, registration etc)
Developer 2 develops 4 functions(Ticket booking functions etc)
Developer 3 develops 5 functions(Payment functions etc)

They will combine all the modules and one proper application will be developed

Testing
========
Testing environment , here only testing will happen
This is our goal  -> Expected = Actual 

Tester ensures whether , Requirement is fulfilled

If he found discrepancy , he will raise a defect,
Developer will fix the defect  -> Retest  -> if working fine means , we can close

All types testing activities will be performed including functional and non-functional

Tester will provide their Approval for deployment

Deployment
==========
Application is deployed to real world users


Maintenance
===========
Maintain the application

==================================================================================================
Methodologies
--------------
1, Waterfall model
2, Agile Model


Waterfall
---------
Sequential execution 

Agile
-----
Parallel execution


Waterfall 
=========
Requirement   (Full requirement)
design
develop
test    ->   Changing requirement is not advisable
deploy

All above will be performed sequentially, one phase is dependant on other phase

Agile 
=====
Design, development and testing process will start parallelly
We have a fixed time interval called Sprint. For every sprint we will have small set of functions to be developed and tested 
Full requirements is splitted in to multiple sprint
1st 3 weeks   -> Login , registration, search field, add to cart, payment -> cash on delivery
deployed
2nd 3 weeks -> Electronics, mobile, payment -> credit card and debit card
deployed
If we have any issue in 1st sprint functions, we can change in next sprints, Even we can change requirements also if needed.
Agile methodology will accept changes
