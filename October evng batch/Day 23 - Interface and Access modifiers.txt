Multiple Inheritance
====================

Is not possible with class in Java
More than one parent class access child class parallelly

We can access multiple classes parallelly, its possible only with interface

Hybrid Inheritance
==================
Combination single and multiple

    A -> b -> c -> d -> A


Access specifiers/Modifiers
=================
public    -> It can be accessed globally (both inside and outside the package) (either you should extends / you should create object for class holding the method)
private   -> It can be accessed only in class (Restricted)
default   -> It can be accessed only inside the package , not outside the package
protected -> It can be accessed inside package , but outside we can access with child class ( you should use extends keyword )


Task
====

Create 4 interface , implement all in a same class 
create 4 abstract class

class 1 -> 1 method with body       3 without body
      2 -> 1 body                   2 without
      3    1                        1
      4 -> complete the one , create object and run
