Scanner Class
=============
Scanner class is used to get the input from user for the operation, we will get inputs in runtime

To access scanner class and its functions, we need to create object for it, and in parameter we have to pass System.in
Scanner obj = new Scanner (System.in);

System -> is a final class
in -> input stream 
System.in , a standard input stream, reads user input from keyboard

methods in scanner:
===================
s.nextInt() -> this will accept integer value
s.nextFloat() -> accepts float value
s.next() -> accepts string value (only one word, if you mention any space, it wont consider the words after space)
s.nextLine() -> accepts string value in a complete line including spaces
s.nextLong() -> accepts Long Value

Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
	     
	     String next = s.next();
	     String b = s.nextLine();
	     int nextInt = s.nextInt();
	     float nextFloat = s.nextFloat();
	     long nextLong = s.nextLong();

Lets break System.out.println();

System -> is a Final class
out -> a static field from System class, also an object of printstream class
println(); -> method from printstream class (It prints the argument passed to it and moves the cursor to the next line (i.e., it includes a newline at the end).
