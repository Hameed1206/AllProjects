Types of Industries
====================

Product-Based Company:
----------------------
A product-based company develops and sells its own software products or hardware devices to customers. The company invests in building a product that can be used by a large number of users or organizations. The product is designed, built, and maintained entirely by the company, and customers purchase it directly.

These companies generate revenue by selling licenses or subscriptions for their products. The focus is on continuous improvement of the product, adding features, and enhancing performance.

Examples: ---------
Microsoft (Windows, Office Suite)
Google (Google Search, Google Ads, Android)
Apple (iPhone, macOS, iOS)
 
Service-Based Company:
----------------------
A service-based company provides customized solutions or services to clients based on their specific needs. These companies do not own products but offer expertise and manpower to create, maintain, or support software, infrastructure, or business processes for other companies.

Service-based companies generate revenue by charging clients for the services provided. The charges may be project-based, hourly, or on a retainer basis.

Examples: ----------
Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)
Infosys
Accenture


Versions of Application
=======================

Alpha Version:
--------------
The alpha version of an application is an early version of the software, often the first complete version, that is released internally or to a limited group of users. It is typically incomplete, with many features still in development or testing.

The alpha version is primarily used for internal testing. The development team and internal testers focus on finding bugs, performance issues, and validating core functionalities. It's a way to ensure that the main features are working, but the software is not yet polished or stable enough for public release.

Beta Version:
-------------
The beta version is a more polished and stable version of the software, released after the alpha phase. It is generally feature-complete but may still have some bugs or performance issues. The goal of the beta release is to get feedback from a larger audience.

The beta version is used for external testing by a broader user base (often called beta testers). This phase helps developers gather real-world feedback, fix remaining bugs, and improve performance and usability.
