Test Reporting
==============
Once All the test cases executed and all defects are fixed, then testing process will be completed, we can proceed for deployment
or
If maximum defects are closed, we have only minor defects left that too won't affect the functionality means, then there will be a meeting to discuss on this and they will decide to go for deployment 

As testers part in test reporting & closure, we should prepare all required documents that has to be provided for current release.
Test Case document will execution results
RTM Document will all related defects and updates
and
Release presentation document, which should consist of test metrics
Lesson learned document, We will sit and discuss what went bad and mistakes that should be avoided, those things we will mention

How to prepare Test metrics
=========================
Using Requirement and Test Cases we will do,
Assume if,
we have 20 requirements, for that 
we have Drafted 300 test cases, so by average we have drafted 15 test cases per requirement

Lets calculated how many test cases executed,
                                   Count            Percentage          How to calculate percentage
Test Cases executed                 285                95%              (Test cases executed /         * 100
                                                                        Total no of test cases) 

Passed Test cases                   210                70%              (Test cases Passed   /         * 100
                                                                        No of test cases Executed)

Failed Test cases                   75                 25%              (Test cases Failed   /         * 100
                                                                        No of test cases Executed)

Blocked Test cases                  15                 05%              (Test cases Blocked   /        * 100
                                                                        Total no of test cases) 

Lets calculated the defect counts,

Total no of defects opened =  100
                                   Count            Percentage          How to calculate percentage
Critical Defects                    25                  25%             (Critical defects/             * 100
                                                                        Total Defects)
High Defects                        50                  50%             (high defects/                 * 100
                                                                        Total Defects)
Medium Defects                      25                  25%             (medium defects/               * 100
                                                                        Total Defects)
Defect leakage                      10                  10%             (Leaked defects/               * 100
                                                                        Total Defects)

Defects fixed                       90                  90%             (Fixed defects/                * 100
                                                                        Total Defects)  
Defects not fixed                   10                  10%             (InProgress defects/           * 100
                                                                        Total Defects)           
Rejected Defects                    10                  10%             (Rejected defects/             * 100
                                                                        Total Defects)

Defect Density          =     No of defects / No of requirements

Defect age   =  fixed date - opened date
