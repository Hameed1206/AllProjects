Testing Techniques:
-------------------

1.Equivalence case partitioning Technique:
-----------------------------------
In equivalence partitioning, the test cases are eqaully divided based upon positive and negative inputs.

Example----1
=============
password text box------> atleast 1sc,1Alphabets,1numeric

TC1----->SC and alphabets

TC2----->SC and Numeric

TC3----->Numeric and Alphabets

TC4----->Numeric ,Alphabets,SC

Example----2
=============
Matrimonial website------Age field------criteria is 21 to 50

Tc1-----    <21

TC2----    21 TO 50

TC3----    >50


Decision Table testing:
-----------------------
In Decision table technique, we deal with combinations of inputs.
To identify the test cases with decision table, we consider conditions and actions.
We take conditions as inputs and actions as outputs.

Example-----1
===========
60% OFFER FOR JEANS----offer is applicable for women whos age is less than 40


TC1--------->Women(T)-------above 40(F)----------Negative----False-------->not applicable

TC2--------->Women(T)-------below 40(T)---------Positive---------------------->offer applicable

Tc3---------->Men(F)----------below 40(T)----------Negative---------------------->not applicable

TC4-------->Men(F)-----------above 40 (F)--------Negative-------------------------->not applicable

Example -2:
==========
    
Conditions  Tc1        Tc2      Tc3           Tc4       Tc5        Tc6

first name    f         f         f           no         f         f

last name    f          f         no           f          f        f

mob no       f          no        f              f          f        no

gender       no         f          f              f         f         no

submit       dis          dis        dis          dis      ena      dis

	  
	  
State Transition Technique:
---------------------------
Using state transition testing, we pick test cases from an application where we need to test different 
system transitions.
We can apply this when an application gives a different output for the same input,depending on what
 has happened in the earlier state.

Example: Login with invalid username and password three times keeps the account page blocked 
until change password.

1st attempt-------wrong password------>Try again

2nd attempt------wrong password------->Try again

3rd attempt-------wrong password------>Account blocked


Boundary Value Analysis:
------------------------
Boundary value analysis is based on testing the boundary values of valid and invalid partitions.
Every partition has its maximum and minimum values and these maximum and minimum values are
 the boundary values of a partition.

Example: If we want to enter an amount between 100 to 1000.
	 Here we check based on boundaries for 100, we take 98,99,101,102 and for 1000, 
we take 998,999,1001,1002.

  Ex:2  characters -- atleast 8  and max 12
   TC1--> 7  ( Invalid )
   TC2--> 8  ( Valid )
   TC3--> 11 ( Valid )
   TC4--> 13 (Invalid)


Error Guessing Technique:
-------------------------
Error Guessing is used to find bugs in software application based on testers prior experience. 
Here we won't follow any specific rules.


Adhoc Testing:
--------------
Ad-hoc testing is quite opposite to the formal testing. 
It is an informal testing type. 
In Adhoc testing, testers randomly test the application without following any documents and test design techniques. 
This testing is primarily performed if the knowledge of testers in the application under test is very high. 
Testers randomly test the application without any test cases or any business requirement document.
